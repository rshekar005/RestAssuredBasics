A cookie is a small piece of data that a server sends to a user's web browser.
The browser may store cookies or may not store cookies, if cookie is stored from the next request browser will send the same cookie to the same server.
Typically it's used to tell if two requests came from the same browser -- Keeping a user logged in


What is cookie based authentication?
Cookie based authentication uses HTTP cookies to authenticate client requests and maintain session information. It works as follows: The client sends a login information to the server. On successful login, the server response includes the set cookies header that contains the cookie name, value, expiry time and some other info etc.
